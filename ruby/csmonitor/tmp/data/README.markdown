I've put some data here to use in programs as text for textareas, textviews or lists.

brew.txt - single list, use in listboxes
color.2  - ANSI formatted text, use in formatted textview
gemlist.txt - single column list
lotr.txt    - running text for text views
ports.txt   - 3 column list, use in tables, tabular
unix1.txt   - running text
unix2.txt   - running text
