ISSUES 

This is a very simple, undo facility. This could change in the near future.

Todo:
We need to handle block updates - several undo ops to be done together.

  # AbstractUndo has the basic workings of the undo redo facility.
  # It leaves the actual undo and redo to the implementing source object. However,
  # it does the work of storing edits, and passing the correct edit to the implementor
  # when the source object calls for an undo or redo operation. It thus manages the edit (undo) queue.

    # initialize the source object which will issue undo requests

      source(_source) #if _source
